# Anime Recommender System
This notebook presents a content-based anime recommender system that utilizes a dataset containing anime titles, ratings, genres, and synopses. The goal of the system is to find similar animes based on genre and synopsis, and provide recommendations to users.

```python
get_recommendations("Cowboy Bebop", sort_by='Score')
```

## Data Cleaning and Pre-processing
The first step in building the recommender system is to clean and pre-process the data. For this task, we used pyspark to perform the necessary operations. The data was cleaned by removing any missing or duplicate values, and then pre-processed by converting the categorical variables (genres) into numerical ones using one hot encoding.

### Vectorization of Synopses
In order to compare the similarity of the synopses, we need to convert them into numerical vectors. To do this, we used TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) to create numerical vectors for each synopsis.

## Similarity Matrices
With the cleaned and pre-processed data, we then created two similarity matrices: one for the genres and one for the synopses. The genre similarity matrix was created by comparing the genres of each anime, while the synopsis similarity matrix was created using the numerical vectors generated by TF-IDF.

### Combining the Matrices
To create the final similarity matrix, we combined the genre and synopsis similarity matrices. This final matrix is then used in a function to retrieve similar animes above a certain threshold, which can be sorted by similarity score or rating.

## Future Improvements
There are several ways in which the performance of the system can be improved. One of the most significant improvements would be to incorporate more features such as year and voice actors. Another approach that can be tried is collaborative filtering, which uses the ratings of users to make recommendations.

## Deployment
In addition to improving the performance of the system, there are also plans to make a front end for the project and deploy it. Additionally, the project will be containerized using Docker to make deployment easier.

## Conclusion
This notebook presents a content-based anime recommender system that utilizes a dataset containing anime titles, ratings, genres, and synopses. By using pyspark for data cleaning and pre-processing, and techniques such as TFIDF and one hot encoding, the system is able to find similar animes based on genre and synopsis. A genre similarity matrix and a synopsis similarity matrix were created and combined to create a final similarity matrix. This final matrix is used in a function to retrieve similar animes above a certain threshold, which can be sorted by similarity score or rating. With future improvements and deployment plans in mind, this system has the potential to provide valuable recommendations to anime fans.
